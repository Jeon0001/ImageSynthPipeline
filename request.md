Hello Jeon,

I hope you're doing well! I could not find your contact information, so I thought to reach out via a pull request.

I’m working on a budgeting app that uses AI. I came across your [OpenAI API key on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AJeon0001%2FImageSynthPipeline%20sk-proj&type=code). I’m broke right now and can’t afford my own, but instead of just borrowing it (which is basically stealing), I thought I'd reach out first.

Would you be okay with me using your key? I’d totally respect any limits you set. 

Also, if you want, I can show you how to hide it better using [environment variables](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/environment-variables/), so it doesn’t end up exposed online in the future. It’s a super easy way to keep your key safe so others don't use your sensitive information or just steal it!

If you’re open to it, Let me know what you think, I’d appreciate it!

Best,
Tolu
